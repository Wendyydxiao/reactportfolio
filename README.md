# React Portfolio

## Description

Being a web developer means being part of a community. We’ll need a place not only to share our projects while we're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share our work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

This is a personal portfolio built with **React** and styled using **Chakra UI**. The portfolio showcases your projects, provides information about you, contact form and professional resume to set you ready for new opportunities and challenges. The page is deployed to Netlify.
